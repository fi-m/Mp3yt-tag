# Mp3dl-tag
Lazy mp3 downloader and tagger – very not good. 

Tons of stuff can be improved, but cba

The process is as follos: 
    download mp4 from yt -> convert to mp3 using ffmpeg -> tag with meta data from discogs

# How to use
Make sure `ffmpeg` is installed

Do `pip install -r requirements.txt`

In `mp3_tagger.py`, change `TOKEN = ` to your discogs access token (google how to get one, if you don't know). 

That is all, enjoy :D
